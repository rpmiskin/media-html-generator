media-html-generator
====================

Generates a set of static html to serve video files.

The inital intent of this is to quickly create some web pages that I can 
serve to allow streaming of my iTunes library.

This may grow (or spawn a separate project) that produces something a little
more dynamic with a database populated by parsing mp4 files.
